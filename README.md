# GraphicVector

This project contains an implementation of a geometric vector and an SFML application that uses and responds to mouse click events.

## Usage

To run the SFML application, simply clone this repository, navigate to the `GraphicVector` directory, and execute the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the source files.

## Geometric Vector

The `Vector` class is a geometric vector implementation that includes several common vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product.

## SFML Application

The application allows the user to rotate one vector and drag another vector by pressing the keys

## Dependencies

This project requires the SFML library to be installed on your system. To install SFML, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
